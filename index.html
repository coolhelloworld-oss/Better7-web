                               Classic 7 is a Windows 10 (IoT Enterprise LTSC 2021) modification made to look 1:1 to Windows 7. 
                               It has all of the goodies that Windows 7 had along with some extras included!
                               Classic 7 features a 1:1 OOBE recreation, meaning it'll feel just like your PC simplified once more.

                            <h3>What features does Classic 7 contain?</h3>
                            <p>
                               Classic 7 comes with most of the features that Windows 7 had, along with some exceptions that may or may not happen to be included in the near future. 
                               Some features included from Windows 7 are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Aero Glass! <a href="">Preview of Aero working</a></li>
                                <li>Support for .themepack files from Windows 7! <a href="">Preview of .themepack files working</a></li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>Some features that aren't brought back from Windows 7 are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>3D animations for windows, this includes opening, closing, minimizing and maximizing a window.</li>
                                <li>Flip 3D isn't brought back as no one has made a port just yet, the alternatives for Flip 3D are horrible and not recommended.</li>
                                <li>Some system applications / gadgets may not work due to incompatibilities between Windows 7 and Windows 10.</li>
                            </ul>
